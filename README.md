This dashboard displays the product performance of a store on the Shopee e-commerce platform, providing several visualizations to assist in analyzing the store's products Using Power BI.

This dataset consists of **24 columns and 321 rows,** obtained from Shopee, containing product performance data from **July to October 2024**. The data provides several insights as follows:
1. The ratio of visitors who view a product page without making a purchase to those who add the product to their cart, providing insight into the product's impact.
2. The ratio of product page views to visitors who intentionally searched for the product, to understand how often the product is searched.
3.A table containing ordered products, total sales in IDR, and the search to visit rate percentage.
4. The ratio between total purchases, product page visits, and product additions to the cart, to identify the correlation between the three.

**Three tools were used in this process:
MySQL
Excel
Power BI**

Data cleaning and preprocessing were done in MySQL with the following steps:
1. Removing unnecessary features
2. Changing data types
3. Cleaning null or empty values
4. Merging tables with sum operations to create one product
7. Transforming data so that each product appears as one row.
